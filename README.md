# üõí Zepto SQL Inventory Analysis

A real-world SQL case study simulating how data analysts work behind the scenes in the e-commerce/retail industry. This project explores inventory data from **Zepto**, a leading quick-commerce startup in India, and demonstrates how SQL can be used to clean messy datasets, explore product-level insights, and generate business-ready analytics.


## üìå Project Overview

This project walks through the entire analytics process ‚Äî from understanding raw inventory data to answering complex business questions using SQL. It is designed to reflect realistic challenges and tasks faced by entry-level data analysts in retail or e-commerce domains.

## üìä Key Business Questions Answered

- What are the top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage?
- Which high-MRP products are out of stock?
- What is the potential revenue per product category?
- Which expensive products have very minimal discount offers?
- Which 5 categories offer the highest average discounts?
- What is the price per gram for products above 100g?
- How can we group products into Low, Medium, Bulk based on weight?
- What is the total inventory weight per category?

## üßº Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Converted price from paise to rupees  
- Removed or handled null and invalid entries  
- Filtered zero-priced or unrealistic data points  
- Casted data types for numeric analysis  

## üõ† Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench** ‚Äì SQL querying & EDA  
- **ChatGPT** ‚Äì Logical guidance & problem-solving  
- **Canva** ‚Äì Final visual storytelling presentation
